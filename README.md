# OfficeFlow
Hey!!

This repository contains sample screenshots from my engineering project. I haven't included the code since it was a team project based on a closed-source license.

The project is a web application that allows users to report office issues, such as air conditioning problems. Thanks to a clear reporting system, presented as a table or heatmap, the administrator can easily collect this data and pass it on to the building manager.

I was responsible for designing and implementing the PostgreSQL database, creating a REST-compliant API to connect the database with the frontend layer, and contributing to the development of the API functions. I also conducted unit tests using Jest.

The application is built using Express.js, Prisma, PostgreSQL, React, and TypeScript.

Here are some sample screenshots:
